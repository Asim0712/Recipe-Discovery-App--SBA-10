## Overview
For this project, we built a client-side “Recipe Discovery” application. This project will serve as a comprehensive demonstration of your mastery of advanced React concepts. The application will allow users to browse recipes by category, search for specific recipes, view detailed recipe information, and manage a personal list of “favorite” recipes.

You will use a free, public API for recipe data and implement a varietys of hooks, state management patterns, and routing solutions to create a feature-rich, single-page application (SPA).

### The challenge
- API Data Parsing Complexity
- State Management 
 - Synchronizing Context API state with localStorage
 - Preventing race conditions in favorite recipe updates
- Routing Complexities
- UI/UX Challenges
 - Coordinating multiple simultaneous API calls
 - Skeleton loading states for recipe cards
 - Performance on low-end devices
- Accessibility
- Error Handling
 - Comprehensive API error states (rate limits, network issues)
 - Graceful degradation for missing recipe data
 - User-friendly error messages

## Features
-  Category browsing
-  Recipe search functionality
-  Detailed recipe view
-  Favorites management
-  Responsive design
-  Loading/error states
